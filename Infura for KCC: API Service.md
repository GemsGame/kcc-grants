## :technologist:Basic information

- Project Name: Infura for KCC: API Service
- Team Name: InfStones
- Payment Address: 0xc8A6Bfe0834FB99340a0Df253d79B7CaE25053b8
- UID: 66392927

## :dart:Project Overview

- Overview: Provide the node and API service so that all the ecosystem developers and projects can quickly access the KCC network without setting up their own infrastructure.
- Project Details: We will provide KCC with an infrastructure platform including public API service, dedicated node service, and data query service. This will significantly lower the entry barrier for projects and developers that want to build on top of the KCC system.

  **(A) Public API Service:**
  Every user could create their own API project on InfStones‚Äôs infrastructure platform to query/broadcast transactions on KCC. We provide the standard plan that allows developers to perform free API requests on the KCC, as well as high quality enterprise service for users with high performance requirements.

  **(B) Dedicated Node Service:**
  Set up a KCC node with just one-click, and get it ready and synced within minutes instead of weeks. It‚Äôs necessary for many projects and developers with high performance and low latency requirements.

  **(C) Archive Data Access**
  Provide archive data access and archive API service to data analysts and other users who need full historical transaction data.

  **In general, we are building the ‚ÄúInfura‚Äù for KCC with the following features:**

  - One-click deployment
  - Fast syncing: Launch fully synced nodes with just 1-click, and reduce syncing time by 99%.
  - Dynamic Scaling: Dynamically adjust allocated resources according to network status.
