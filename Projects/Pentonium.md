## üì°Future Plans
      We are looking to work on the pain points of the freelance industry and ease them using cutting edge technology and user-friendly apps. We are thinking about fiat on-ramp as this may ease the hassle for non-crypto users and let us compete with even centralised platforms. We have future plans to relase apps for client first approch and remote jobs.
      

## üôãAdditional Information ‚ûï
We started working on the product side (MVP) last December, which we deployed this March along with the smart contracts. We are now working towards the completion of the core contracts for the main product of which 70% is done, and would like to go for auditing by this month. We partnered with Hypersign recently to profile our users.
