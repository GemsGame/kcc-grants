## üéØProject Overview

### Overview:
DeFi Trading made simple, with a fun storytelling twist

### Project Details:

Fool's Tools aims to make things way simpler than they are now. The current DeFi ecosystem offers huge opportunitis and will be the economic foundation of the next decades. But today it's also way too intimidating for the average users. Everything feels pioneristic for a new user, with a series of intimidating and complex services that you need to know in advance.

Coming from a B2B/B2C company with apps that are daily used by hundreds of thousands of happy users we know that there is a better way.

We started with a wallet tool and token explorer that integrates **exchanges, price alerts, charting, wallet tracking**, and many other features. This part is already live in BSC at [https://www.foolstools.net](https://www.fornacestudio.com).

	Connect your wallet and you're ready to be a better trader!
	
	ü§ë Quick Swap (automatically finds the best exchange for you)
	ü©≤ True Auto-slippage suggestion based on realtime data
	üì® Price Alerts
	üìà Token Charts (w/ minicharts directly in your wallet list)
	ü•á Community votes on tokens
	üî• Trending tokens list
	üîç Wallet and transactions tracker
	üí¨ Token comments
	üìÜ New features weekly released
	üõ£ Roadmap here: https://www.foolstools.net/


And this is the current foundation of the project.

Once it's completed, the average user will fulfill all of their monetary tasks within the app, all in a natural way.

The development is frenzy with multiple weekly updates and constant developer's involvement in the community.

Currently we're the only ones giving accurate sell prices for the tokens in the user portfolio, free access to wallet tracking with buy/sell points on the chart, email price alerts, curated token pages. We're currenlty building a universal charting library that doesn't require external API providers.

#### Cameras are on

All of this happens while the camera is on: there is a webseries characterizing some of the real people involved in the project.

Channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOmXKtJPcWoof0LRpdbU7vQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymm0gyrOXzo)

The characters depicted in the videos have a very strong connection with their real-life counterparts. We could say the webseries is about 80% real.

We release a new episode in average every 2 weeks. The story is written with the contribution of an awarded LA-based screenwriter.

#### Loss Reversal

@ffrappo insisted that this should be a featured point of the features list

Since the launch of test token wasn't accompanied by a pre-sale, we had zero marketing budget and we're focusing on organic adoption. 

Because of this we're very open to parthership proposals that can help making the project succeed in the next 2-4 years, including hiring more devs, dedicated marketing funding and staff.

Our future plan is being the most used and loved DeFi app.

Coming from the regular business world, the first thing we learned in DeFi is that good, durable success needs patience. Our scope of work is about 4 years.
