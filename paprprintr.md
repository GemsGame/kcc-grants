## üéØProject Overview

          - Overview
      We aim to connect DeFi with the real world. paprprintr at its core, is an algorithmic stablecoin driven by elastic expansion and burn. Inspired by Basis Cash and other predecessors, we have applied principles of those protocols and innovated our own new mechanisms that effectively maintains the $1 peg level.  Now at 2+ months above peg on the Binance Smart Chain; and into epoch 230 at the time of authoring this proposal.  Our community has a saying they are constantly joking with each other, ‚ÄúHey! Remember that time PAPR lost its peg?‚Äù The joke being PAPR has never lost its peg; due to our advancements in algorithmic stablecoin technology.


          - Project Details
      paprprintr, as stated above, is an algorithmic stablecoin with new mechanisms. Those mechanisms are the first of their kind; never before implemented by any other project in DeFi; which is why we had no choice but to develop them in-house.

      Our goal for this unique stable token is not only to be an algorithmic stablecoin, but also to be the primary currency of the PAPR ecosystem. The next app we are preparing to launch (after paprprintr protocol itself launches on the KCC) is paprjobs.
      paprjobs is a general marketplace for freelancer services in the DeFi space. Unlike other freelance platforms, the freelancer gets to be paid in DeFi tokens (PAPR). After the job is accepted, PAPR tokens are committed to the job by the hiring party (original job poster).  While the task is being completed, the DeFi tokens (PAPR) are being farmed, providing the freelancer additional gains in interest by the end of the job; a unique incentive enabled by DeFi technology. Our culture of innovation at paprprintr feels like a perfect fit with KCC; thanks to your flexible structure and our shared visions to expand DeFi‚Äôs reach to the masses.

    - Team Profiles
        Lex, 26, lives in France. Loves sports in general and streaming some video games when he‚Äôs not chasing new DeFi opportunities

        HashM, 26, French, lives in Hong Kong, passionate about development since young, was always around a computer trying to code new stuff. Loves to sleep/eat when he doesn‚Äôt code.

        IamBlueDev (but they call me BlueDev), 21, French guy too. I‚Äôm currently completing my degree in engineering. I am entrepreneurial minded, working in this startup and I will surely develop my own startup, some day in the future, once paprprintr is rounded out and robust. I am compelled to develop everyday, it‚Äôs my passion and a big part of my life.

        iGuttenberg, 43, lives in France and inside the crypto sphere. Passionate about the future of technology, IT professional for 20 years. Solidity developer with official certification.

        Major Rawdawg, 41, American. Loves IT/technology and spending time with his son.  Brings 20-years of entrepreneurial and business experience, as well as assisting with streaming and community needs.

        JacksJucks, 21, Russian. Near completion of my degree in civil engineering.
        I often cannot sleep at night because my brain is constantly busy with thoughts of new solutions to problems I encounter in life. I love to work out problems in my mind and bring my ideas to life.


    - Team's experience

        Hash & Lex earned Master‚Äôs degrees in Economics & International Trade, leading them to their passion for cryptocurrencies, which presented itself as the natural path the more they learned and got more deeply involved. 


The Community Team, composed of (pseudonyms) JacksJucks,Major Rawdawg,and a new addition in the near future, bring experience and depth to complement each other and the main project team well.  JacksJucks is very innovative and analytical in nature; he is formally educated in Civil Engineering.  He brings a unique perspective to project development, improvements, and critical review.  Possessing the capability to invent a new idea and then proceed to run it through the engineering design process until it is a well refined product that will impress the community and add value to the project overall.  Major is an American entrepreneur with two-decades of business experience; owning and operating his own IT service company.  He has knowledge and experience in developing all aspects of business; including putting rubber to the road from business plan to real execution.  Major has also experienced and lived through all the highs and lows of operating a startup as well as structuring for longevity.  He can see potential risks and pitfalls that may not be obvious to anyone who has not been through it.

The Community Team assists the main project team, acting as a brain trust; bringing fresh ideas and perspective to every conversation.  The Community Team also responds to and supports many community requests, serving as a layer of relief for the main project team; allowing them to focus on project development, testing, and implementation (as much as possible).  Both teams work together fluidly with an effortless balance enabled by the main project team‚Äôs willingness to open themselves to critique and taking genuine interest in the concerns of their community and the project‚Äôs performance overall.  The results of this effort towards partnership and cooperation allows for a performance and efficiency level normally only achievable in workflow systems such as LEAN; but with an even stronger human element, putting people first.  Long-term, this cultural characteristic of the paprprintr team will drive the project far beyond the hurdles so many businesses and projects self-destruct under.

## üèÜDevelopment Roadmap

 Overview
 

- Milestone 1 : Launching the paprprintr protocol on KCC

      - Estimated Duration: 1 week

             - FTE:
            300 hours (includes estimates for assumed project slack at $40 per hour, per person for team/staff and $20 per hour for community team)
		55   x 2 (Lex and Hash)
		50   x 2 (IamBlueDev and iGuttenberg)
		45   x 1 New employee hire for web development
		22.5 x 2 Community team

             - Costs:
            * Labor/Team Cost $17,000
		$10,200 (Team/staff)
		$900    (Community Team)
		$3,900  (Project Slack and miscellaneous)
            $2,000 team expenses (softwares, services subscriptions, collaboration tools, hardware, onboarding materials)

            * Launch/marketing/promotions/airdrop/user-adoption $60,000:
		$35,000 Marketing Firm with history of successful DeFi launches
		$20,000 Airdrops (Two scenarios described below) and contests
		$5,000 Additional cushion to allow flexibility to enter newly available promotions, additional runs/extensions, extension of pre-sale etc

            * $200,000 for liquidity
            Total Cost Milestone 1 : $277,000

            Description of non-liquidity funds allocation (milestone 1) - 
            The $60,000 is dedicated to a grand-opening style launch to gain exposure on large DeFi platforms/websites, pay for creation of professional graphics/videos/marketing content, and conduct high-profile social media contests to drive traffic and exposure to the new KCC platform which guarantees adoption of new wallets and token holders in the paprprntr KCC ecosystem.  Airdrops will also be made to those already on other chains with paprprntr.  They can sign-up to receive an initial starting bag on the KCC chain to further push the success and adoption of the new launch with a vesting period of 6-months for airdropped funds (they can stake and invest the funds, but must keep them in the ecosystem for a minimum of 6-months).  This will help assure and encourage other participants (large and small) to enter the KCC and make both the project and chain stronger and more attractive with a strong support level of TVL.  
            There will be two types of airdrops.  First, a thank you reward to the OGs who have stuck in there since the beginning, through the good times and challenging times; many of which have selflessly devoted time/energy volunteering to ensure the project remained strong to get this far.  This will entrench trust and loyalty with our strongest organic promoters.  Second airdrop, will be to individuals who sign up for the special presale (open and fair with limited capacity).  We will offer these individuals an opportunity to purchase up to 5 PRNTR tokens that will be matched with (up to) 5 additional PRNTR tokens.  This special presale will be open to anyone who wants to sign up; and terms will be made very clear that PRNTR tokens purchased with this matching promotion, must stay on paprprntr KCC ecosystem for 6-months (smart contract enforced).  They will be able to stake, farm, or invest the funds how they please within the ecosystem; and after 6-months can remove the funds if they so choose.
            $17,000 for labor and expenses needed to complete development, smart contracts, and accommodate extra help required to support the community‚Äôs requests during development.

 ...
 
- Milestone 2 : Making PAPR crosschain between KCC & Polygon/BSC

      - Estimated Duration: 1 month

              - FTE: 1,540 hours 
            (includes estimates for assumed project slack at $40 per hour, per person for team/staff, and $20 per hour for community team)
		220 x 2 (Lex and Hash)
		200 x 2 (IamBlueDev and iGuttenberg)
		215 x 1 Employee (Web Developer)
		215 x 1 New Solidity Developer
		90  x 3 Community team


              - Costs:

	      $50,800 (Team/staff)
	      $5,400  (Community Team)
	      $3,800  (Project Slack and miscellaneous)

            Description of funds allocation (milestone 2) -
            In order to make PAPR crosschain, a certain amount of development is required. The funds will be used to remunerate current members of the team, but also new developpers as the amount of work will be too heavy for the current team to do.
            Then, marketing wise, we will go for our usual marketing strategy when it comes to the DeFi public i.e. videos, AMAs, visuals, announcements. This comes with a cost as editing quality content requires a professional.

            Total Cost Milestone 2 : $60,000
...

- Milestone 3 : Launching paprjobs, the freelance x DeFi platform, on KCC


      -  Estimated Duration: 1.5 months

              - FTE:
            2,310 hours (includes estimates for assumed project slack at $40 per hour, per person for team/staff and $20 per hour for community team)
		330   x 2 (Lex and Hash)
		300   x 2 (IamBlueDev and iGuttenberg)
		322.5 x 1 Employee (Web Developer)
		322.5 x 1 New Solidity Developer
		135   x 3 Community team
 

              - Costs:

          *$76,200 (Team/staff)
	      *$8,100  (Community Team)
	      *$5,700  (Project Slack and miscellaneous)
          *$6,000 marketing (as described below)
          *$4,000 team expenses (softwares, services subscriptions, collaboration tools, hardware, onboarding materials)

            Total Cost Milestone 3 : $100,000


            Description of funds allocation (milestone 3) -


            The funds allocated to the launch of paprjobs will be used to pay the team that will focus on completing the development and design of practical function and coding.  Funds will also go towards marketing the launch.  We were fortunate to establish an excellent collaboration with a renowned marketing agent, who has helped several projects in the past; leading them to great results.

            In addition, advertisement videos, visuals, and targeted group AMAs will be realised in order to gain the visibility and traction that is required for this type of platform, as it will also focus on adoption and introduction to the non-DeFi public (a currently untapped base that most DeFi ignores).


      Total proposed grant amount requested: $437,000


...

## üì°Future Plans

Our vision and mission is to develop the paprprintr ecosystem far beyond the current reach of DeFi. We are going to continue connecting DeFi to the real world with more apps and use cases, the first (of many) being paprjobs. As we progress, we will enable people the opportunity to use their cryptocurrencies for real world goods and services, an area of life currently monopolized by a few multi-national players.  If awarded this grant, KCC will become ground zero for this innovative expansion that we are ready to bridge into the real world for the mainstream average person. Building use cases for tokens such as KCS and PAPR for purposes other than just speculation. Our loyal and diverse community, which delivers for us as much as we do for them, has proven itself to be an endless wellspring of great ideas and requests on exactly how they want real world products and services implemented through DeFi in their lives.

      

## üôãAdditional Information ‚ûï


- Team evolution : Over the course of the project, new members joined the team. The core team focuses on the overall code development, while the community team helps paprprintr to gain more visibility. We called it ‚ÄúThe fellowship of PAPR‚Äù !
How volunteers help around
Our community is the best in DeFi.  Everyone reading these words has experienced how toxic a place the internet and DeFi can become without good community and leadership.  We at paprprntr are devoted to community interaction and listening to the needs of our community.  This makes us uniquely strong and able to weather challenging times like the early phases of our startup.
Current strategies outside of the papr ecosystem :
On-demand vaults => The team does on-demand vaults for the community depending on what the market offers. The primary function of these vaults is to automatically compound the interest earned through DeFi, to optimize their yield. A lot of people don‚Äôt like manual compounding; and this type of service has been well received and very popular. 


The vaults also deliver function to the PAPR strategy; as, it takes a performance fee every compound. The benefits generated by the fees are then reinvested to make the fund stronger. The fund is then used whenever PAPR needs to be bought back.

In addition to these vaults, there will be a youtube investment channel that will be released. A member of the team will explain which asset he invested in and for what reason. Most of the assets that get invested in will then be proposed to be farmed in vaults. This strategy is good for both visibility and discovery of new and beneficial investments for the community.

- Organic growth, partnerships
paprprntr team and community function as a single organism.  We create what they want and need; and they allow us tolerance while new implementations are being evaluated and always offer very constructive feedback.  This synergy has led to an incredibly strong, mutual loyalty to one another and has attracted some extremely talented individuals to volunteer their time and energy to building the best product possible.  Another positive side-effect of this; instead of us having to seek out great talent, we have a wealth of great talent highly motivated to improve the project and the community.  Some of those community members are becoming so valuable that they are crossing the threshold into becoming part-time team members.  Bringing their own recognition and trusted reputations into the community at-large.  It has been truly humbling to observe this phenomena unfold since launch and serves as motivation for our team to take pleasure in ‚Äúhead-down, complete the task‚Äù efficiency.
It‚Äôs also worth noting, this type of organic growth and community development is much stronger in the end.  While other projects get brief pumps from hype and marketing (which we experience also), our loyal community works together to grow and cross each chasm to the next milestone in our journey together.  The strongest and most successful businesses and communities begin exactly as we are.  And it‚Äôs very exciting to be part of.


- Commitment, daily routine

Day to day, we focus on making the project grow, whether it is by scanning the different projects on which we can create new vaults or developing and expanding exposure to the paprprintr ecosystem itself through code, articles, videos, investments, etc‚Ä¶

We keep the members of the team informed about what we will do and what has been accomplished.  Then we hold an open discussion allowing two-way communication; this ensures we do not miss critical or urgent matters, while getting everyone on the same page to move forward.  Core team members gather 5 times per week (minimum) on a voice chat, to further ensure there are no gaps in communication and translation across our diverse team.

HashM focuses on everything that is code related on a daily basis and works on developing new vaults and new projects.  His focus is currently prioritized on developing the paprjobs freelance service.  HashM dedicates 15 hours to paprprintr each day!  And loves (almost) every minute of it.

Lex handles all of the marketing, communication, and strategic planning; he evaluates the feasibility and value of all potential opportunities in the market and directs which are worth pursuing.  Lex‚Äôs skillset, education, and instincts play very well to his primary goal of finding the latest innovations, the newest improvements to tokenomics, parsing the economic (macro and micro) landscape of crypto as only he can.  This includes identifying any drawbacks while also developing the best path to enhance the efficiency and deliverables of the overall project‚Äôs work; and through his analysis and methodology, creating the best product and outcomes possible for the team, the project, and the community at large.

IamBlueDev and iGuttenberg contribute to the project as directed by Lex and HashM‚Äôs final decision, after considering all information and viewpoints available.  IamBlueDev and iGuttenberg have become hand-in-glove with outputting deliverables which leadership has deemed the highest priority.  Community members are often commenting at how astounded they are at the break-neck speeds we as a team are able to put out high quality vaults, changes, and requests.  We are not at all trying to boast; we are humbled by the incredible fortune we have to be able to assist in culturing a community with positive, tolerant, and respectful behavior, which is too often absent in the DeFi space.   This is why we feel uniquely positioned to make best use of this grant if awarded to us.  Please help us realize this vision that we are on a real path to achieve.  That vision being; the true practice of making DeFi useful and accessible to all.  With real use cases, real community feedback, and a real and deep passion to leave this world better off than we found it.  If that is something you believe in too; let‚Äôs build it together.
